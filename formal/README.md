## Current boundary

Implemented and kernel-checked:

- ordered effect words and subsequence subeffecting;
- monoid, monotonicity, optional-interface insertion and empty-bound lemmas;
- typed base/free signatures with lookup uniqueness;
- fine-grain value/computation syntax in which source operations have no
  continuation argument;
- extrinsic, proof-relevant typing derivations, including latent arrow effects
  and subeffecting;
- capture-avoiding de Bruijn renaming/substitution functions;
- simultaneous value/computation renaming and substitution preservation,
  including substitution under binders and closed-value substitution;
- CBV `let` evaluation contexts, internal reductions and exposed base/free
  request records whose continuations are reconstructed from contexts.
- canonical return inversion through arbitrary outer subeffecting;
- one-step preservation for every internal reduction rule;
- typed evaluation contexts, plugging preservation and typed reconstruction of
  exposed free requests.
- converse plugging decomposition and reconstruction of typed residual
  contexts;
- request-grade factorization
  `[free interface] * suffix ≤ declaredEffect`;
- interface-free-bound safety under the concrete no-erasure preorder;
- closed progress into return/internal/base/free boundaries and deterministic
  internal stepping.
- a separate affine shallow-handler machine with matching, bare-continuation
  resumption, and transparent base/nonmatching forwarding;
- partial handler lookup, an independent exhaustiveness predicate, local
  clause-typing certificates and checked parameter instantiation;
- executable `tick`/`tock` witnesses showing that matching removes the pending
  handler while a missing same-interface clause forwards and reinstalls it.

Typing derivations live in `Type` rather than `Prop`: this exposes the explicit
subeffecting derivation tree needed by the terminating mutual transformation.
The associated inhabitation proposition can later be proof-irrelevant even
though the checked certificate is retained as data.

The next obligation is the ordered output-grade transformer for affine
handling.  In particular, continuation retyping must expose the optionality
needed to replace `b * [free interface] * e` by `b * clauseEffect * e`;
this is intentionally not hidden inside the operational machine. No `sorry`
or project axiom is admitted in the checked library.
